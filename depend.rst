Requesting USE flags on the Python interpreter
==============================================
While the majority of Python standard library modules are available
unconditionally, a few are controlled by USE flags.  For example,
the sqlite3_ module requires ``sqlite`` flag to be enabled
on the interpreter.  If a package requires this module, it needs
to enforce the matching flag via a USE dependency.

In order to create a USE dependency on the Python interpreter, set
``PYTHON_REQ_USE`` before inheriting the eclass.  This will cause
the eclass to generate appropriate dependency string in ``PYTHON_DEPS``.

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 7

    # Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2

    EAPI=8

    PYTHON_COMPAT=( python3_12 )
    PYTHON_REQ_USE="sqlite"

    inherit python-r1 gnome2-utils meson xdg-utils

    REQUIRED_USE="${PYTHON_REQUIRED_USE}"

    DEPEND="${PYTHON_DEPS}
        ..."

Full USE dependency syntax is permitted.  For example, you can make
the dependency conditional to a flag on the package:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 8,22

    # Copyright 1999-2024 Gentoo Authors

    IUSE="mongodb mysql postgres +sqlite"

Finally, there are cases when the problem cannot be fully solved using
a single USE dependency.  Additional Python interpreter dependencies
with specific USE flags can be constructed using ``python_gen_impl_dep``
helper then.  For example, the following ebuild requires Python with
SQLite support when running tests:

.. index:: python_gen_cond_dep; for conditional deps

Dependencies conditional to Python version
==========================================
When packaging software for multiple Python versions, it is quite likely
that you'll find yourself needing some packages only with some
of the versions, and not with others.  This is the case with backports
and other compatibility packages.  It also happens if some
of the optional dependencies do not support the full set
of implementations your package supports.

A dependency that applies only to a subset of ``PYTHON_COMPAT`` can
be created using ``python_gen_cond_dep`` function (the same as used
in ``python-single-r1``).  It takes a dependency string template,
followed by zero or more implementation arguments.  The dependencies
are output for every matching implementation.

The dependency template should contain literal (usually escaped through
use of single quotes) ``${PYTHON_USEDEP}`` that will be substituted
with partial USE dependency by the eclass function (when using
``python-single-r1``, ``${PYTHON_SINGLE_USEDEP}`` is also permitted).

The implementation arguments can be:

1. Literal implementation names.  For example, if a particular feature
   is only available on a subset of Python implementations supported
   by the package::

       RDEPEND="
           cli? (
               $(python_gen_cond_dep '
                   dev-python/black[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
                   dev-python/click[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
               ' python3_{8..10})
           )
       "

2. ``fnmatch(3)``-style wildcard against implementation names.
   For example, CFFI is part of PyPy's stdlib, so the explicit package
   needs to be only installed for CPython::

       RDEPEND="
           $(python_gen_cond_dep '
               dev-python/cffi[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
           ' 'python*')
       "

   Remember that the patterns need to be escaped to prevent filename
   expansion from happening.

3. Python standard library versions that are expanded into appropriate
   implementations by the eclass.  For example, this makes it convenient
   to depend on backports::

       RDEPEND="
           $(python_gen_cond_dep '
               dev-python/backports-zoneinfo[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
           ' 3.8)
       "

   The advantage of this form is that the dependencies automatically
   adjust as we switch PyPy3 to a newer stdlib version.

An important feature of ``python_gen_cond_dep`` is that it handles
removal of old implementations gracefully.  When one of the listed
implementations is no longer supported, it silently ignores it.  This
makes it possible to remove old implementations without having to update
all dependency strings immediately.

For example, in the following example the dependency became empty when
Python 3.7 was removed::

    RDEPEND="
        $(python_gen_cond_dep '
            dev-python/importlib_metadata[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
        ' python3_7)"


.. index:: cffi, greenlet

Dependencies on CFFI and greenlet
=================================
The PyPy distribution includes special versions of the cffi_
and greenlet_ packages.  For this reason, packages using CFFI
and/or greenlet and supporting PyPy3 need to make the explicit
dependencies conditional to CPython::

    RDEPEND="
        $(python_gen_cond_dep '
            >=dev-python/cffi-1.1.0:=[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
        ' 'python*')
    "


.. _sqlite3: https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html
.. _cffi: https://pypi.org/project/cffi/
.. _greenlet: https://pypi.org/project/greenlet/


.. index:: test-rust

Optional test suite dependencies on Rust packages
=================================================
When the test suite of a high-profile Python package starts depending
on Python-Rust packages, it may not be feasible to mask the package
on all architectures that are not supported by Rust.  In this case,
it is preferable to skip the tests that require the particular
dependencies.

If upstream does not handle missing dependencies gracefully and refuses
to merge a patch to do so, it is possible to conditionally deselect
tests from the ebuild based on whether the particular dependencies are
installed::

    python_test() {
        local EPYTEST_DESELECT=()

        if ! has_version "dev-python/trustme[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]"; then
            EPYTEST_DESELECT+=(
                tests/test_requests.py::TestRequests::test_https_warnings
            )
        fi

        epytest
    }

Note that if the modules are imported in outer scope, ignoring the whole
test file may be necessary.  If a file contains both tests requiring
the dependency and other useful tests, sometimes it is possible
to convince upstream to move imports into specific test functions,
in order to make it possible to deselect specific tests.

If the tests requiring these packages are not very important, it is
acceptable to skip the dependency and assume they would be run
if the package was installed independently.  However, if they are
significant (e.g. tests for TLS support), the ``test-rust`` flag
can be used to pull them in, e.g.::

    IUSE="test test-rust"
    RESTRICT="!test? ( test )"

    BDEPEND="
        test? (
            test-rust? (
                dev-python/trustme[${PYTHON_USEDEP}]
            )
        )
    "

This flag is masked on profiles for architectures that do not provide
a Rust toolchain, and forced on all the remaining profiles.  This
ensures that the respective tests are run whenever it is possible
to run them.
